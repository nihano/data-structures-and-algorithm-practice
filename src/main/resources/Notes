Tree is a naturally recursive structure.
Requirements: LinkedList, Recursion, Stack, Queue

Represent hierarchical data
Usage:
-Database: generally trees are used in databases to access entities faster.
Otherwise, search start from the beginning and in db there is large size of data.
-Autocompletion
-Compilers: compiler needs to check if the written code is compatible with the syntax
of the language.
-Compression algorithm (JPEG, MP3)

Tree
-is a data structure similar to a linked list but instead each node pointing
simply to the next node in a linear fashion, each node points to a number of nodes.
-Tree is an example of "non-linear data structure".
-A tree structure is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure
in a graphical form.


In Linked list we can access the elements starting from the first one in an order
Nodes in a tree are not in a linear order.
